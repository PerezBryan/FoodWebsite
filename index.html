            <p> Eating the same food for dinner can be exhausting.
                Want to try something new? Well look no further! FumbleEats will guide you to what you’re
                looking for. A community of students are out there to help you find what you crave. Connect
                with the community to help you decide what might be the best choice for dinner or any meal of
                the day. We understand keeping a good meal plan in college can be difficult given certain
                restrictions, and that’s what FumbleEats wants to help you with. FumbleEats want to ensure
                you have an easier time searching for what you want. You worked hard to get into college and
                the journey will continue to get more difficult, and we want every student to have a memorable
                experience at UofSC, and FumbleEats wants to make that come true for the students at UofSC.
